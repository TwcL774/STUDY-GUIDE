# Service Package

* The Service package is an abstraction layer that separates the business logic from the presentation layer which is the controller package in project zero. It has methods that provide a consistent interface for accessing and manipulating data and performing business related task.

* It also encapsulate operations, such as database queries and data transformation. By isolating these operations in the service package, the controller package can focus on displaying information and handling user input without worrying about the underlying implementations.

## Repository Package

* The repository package is a design pattern that isolate the data access layer from business logic and presentation layer. It is used to abstract the communication with the data storage and implementations for data queries and data transformations.
